## Project Name: Booming Bulls Academy Web Service

### Description:
The Booming Bulls Academy web service is designed to provide a seamless user experience for our academy's platform, offering endpoints for users to access information about our vision, mission, success stories, and contact details.

## Key Features
* ### Stateless Architecture
Each request from the client to the server contains all the information needed to understand and process the request, ensuring scalability and reliability.
* ### Resource-Based
Resources are identified by URIs, with endpoints for various data points such as our address, email, contact information, and more.
* ### Uniform Interface
Utilizes standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources.
* ### Cacheable Responses
Ensures that responses are appropriately marked as cacheable to enhance performance and efficiency.
* ### Layered System
The architecture supports scalability and manageability by organizing the system into layers.
## Technical Details
### Frontend:
HTML/CSS: Used for the structure and styling of the web pages.
JavaScript: Implemented for dynamic and interactive elements.
### Backend: 
Developed using backend technology used Java.
## Learning and Challenges
* ### Well-Structured Architecture
- Ensured the project followed REST principles for better scalability and maintenance.
* ### State Management
- Addressed challenges related to maintaining statelessness in the architecture.
* ### Resource Representation
- Efficiently represented resources using URIs and standard HTTP methods.
